# A Simple Socket Library for non-blocking Sockets

The `sock` linrary was born to solve [many concerns](sock_why) that pop up when using the system sockets API directly.

It supports TCP/IP sockets as well as unix doamin sockets. Pipes can also be attached to the library.

## A Simple API

The `sock.h` API can be divided into a few different categories:

- General helper functions

- Accepting connections and opening new sockets.

- Sending and receiving data.

- Direct user level buffer API.

- Read/Write Hooks.
